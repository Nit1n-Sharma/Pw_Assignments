    "Q1. What is MongoDB? Explain non-relational databases in short. In which scenarios is it preferred to use MongoDB over SQL databases?\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB:\n",
    "MongoDB is a popular NoSQL (non-relational) database management system that provides a flexible and scalable way to store and manage data. It stores data in BSON (Binary JSON) format, which is a binary-encoded serialization of JSON-like documents. MongoDB is known for its scalability, flexibility, and ease of use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-Relational Databases:\n",
    "Non-relational databases, often referred to as NoSQL databases, are a type of database management system that doesn't rely on the traditional relational database model. Unlike SQL databases, NoSQL databases are schema-less and can handle various types of data, including structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data. They are designed to be scalable and perform well with large amounts of data and high-velocity data streams.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scenarios to Prefer MongoDB over SQL Databases:\n",
    "MongoDB is preferred over SQL databases in scenarios where:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Scalability: MongoDB is designed to scale horizontally by adding more servers to the database. It handles large amounts of data and high traffic efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Schema Flexibility: MongoDB does not enforce a rigid schema, allowing developers to work with flexible data models. This is particularly useful in scenarios where the data structure evolves over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Handling Unstructured Data: MongoDB excels at handling unstructured or semi-structured data, making it suitable for scenarios like document storage and content management.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Agile Development: MongoDB's document-oriented model aligns well with agile development practices, allowing developers to iterate quickly and adapt to changing requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Geospatial Data: MongoDB provides robust support for geospatial data and queries, making it suitable for applications that involve location-based services.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. State and Explain the features of MongoDB.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Features of MongoDB:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Document-Oriented: MongoDB stores data in JSON-like BSON documents, providing a flexible and rich data model.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Schema-less: MongoDB doesn't enforce a rigid schema, allowing developers to work with evolving data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Scalability: MongoDB is designed to scale horizontally, making it suitable for handling large amounts of data and high-traffic applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Indexing: Supports various types of indexes to optimize query performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Aggregation Framework: Provides powerful aggregation capabilities for performing complex data transformations and analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Ad Hoc Queries: Allows for ad hoc queries using a rich query language, including support for regular expressions and geospatial queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Sharding: Enables horizontal scaling by distributing data across multiple servers.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Replication: Supports automatic replication for high availability and fault tolerance.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Geospatial Indexing: Provides geospatial indexing and queries for location-based data.\n",
    "\n",
    "    GridFS: Allows storing and retrieving large files, such as images or videos."
