    "Database:\n",
    "A database is a structured collection of data that is organized and stored for efficient retrieval and management. It can store a variety of data types, such as text, numbers, images, and more. Databases are crucial for storing and managing large volumes of data in a way that allows for easy access, retrieval, and manipulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL (Structured Query Language) Databases:\n",
    "SQL databases are relational databases that use a structured query language (SQL) for defining and manipulating the data. These databases use a schema to define the structure of the data, and they are typically well-suited for complex query-intensive operations. SQL databases are known for their ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties, which ensure data integrity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of SQL databases include MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server.\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL Databases:\n",
    "NoSQL databases, as the name suggests, do not use SQL as their primary query language. They are designed to handle large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data and are often used for scenarios where scalability, flexibility, and performance are crucial. NoSQL databases can be categorized into several types, including document-oriented, key-value stores, column-family stores, and graph databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some popular NoSQL databases include MongoDB (document-oriented), Cassandra (column-family), Redis (key-value), and Neo4j (graph).\n",

    "\n",
    "Primary Key:\n",
    "A primary key is a column or a set of columns in a database table that uniquely identifies each record in that table. It must contain unique values and cannot have NULL values. The primary key is used to establish relationships between tables, and it ensures the integrity and uniqueness of each record in the table.\n",

    "In this example, the StudentID column is the primary key.\n",
    "\n",
    "Foreign Key:\n",
    "A foreign key is a column or a set of columns in a database table that refers to the primary key of another table. It establishes a link between the two tables, creating a relationship. The foreign key is used to ensure referential integrity, meaning that each value in the foreign key column must match a value in the primary key of the referenced table or be NULL.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of defining a foreign key in a table:\n",

    "\n",
    "Now, here's a simple Python code example to connect to a MySQL database, create a cursor, and execute a basic SQL query:\n",

    "\n",
    "# Close the cursor and the database connection\n",
    "cursor.close()\n",
    "connection.close()\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "    The mysql.connector.connect(**db_config) statement establishes a connection to the MySQL database using the provided configuration.\n",
    "    The cursor() method creates a cursor object, which is used to interact with the database.\n",
    "    The execute() method is used to execute SQL queries. In this example, it executes a query to create a table (ExampleTable). Note that IF NOT EXISTS ensures that the table is created only if it doesn't already exist.\n",
    "    The commit() method is called to commit the changes to the database. This step is essential for making permanent changes.\n",
    "    Finally, the close() method is used to close the cursor and the database connection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7. Give the order of execution of SQL clauses in an SQL query.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a SQL query, the clauses are typically executed in the following order:\n",
    "\n",
    "    FROM: Specifies the tables from which data will be retrieved.\n",
    "    WHERE: Applies conditions to filter the rows retrieved from the tables specified in the FROM clause.\n",
    "    GROUP BY: Groups the result set based on one or more columns.\n",
    "    HAVING: Applies conditions to the grouped rows, similar to the WHERE clause but for grouped data.\n",
    "    SELECT: Specifies the columns to be retrieved from the tables.\n",
    "    ORDER BY: Sorts the result set based on one or more columns.\n",
    "    LIMIT / OFFSET (or FETCH FIRST / NEXT): Limits the number of rows returned or skips a specified number of rows (not supported by all database systems)."
